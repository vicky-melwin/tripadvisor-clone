🚀 Just launched my new personal project – TripAdvisor Replica!
I’ve built a frontend-only replica of the popular travel platform TripAdvisor, designed entirely with HTML and CSS to practice layout design, styling, and responsiveness.

🔗 Live Demo: https://vicky-melwin.github.io/tripadvisor-clone/

🎯 Project Highlights:

Responsive Navigation Bar with TripAdvisor-style branding, menu items, search bar, and sign-in button

Category-based title section with icons for Hotels, Flights, Restaurants, and more

Promotional banners with call-to-action buttons

Experience showcases – grids featuring “Things to do”, “Top Attractions”, and curated trip ideas

Plan your trip sections with promotional cards for food, tours, and cultural experiences

Location-based recommendations with interactive hover effects and image overlays

Travel inspiration section with curated travel stories

Custom footer with informational links, policies, and company details

Fully responsive layout using Flexbox and media queries for mobile and tablet screens

💡 What I Learned:

Structuring large-scale HTML projects with reusable CSS classes

Implementing Flexbox for complex layouts and responsive design

Styling elements with hover effects and box shadows for modern UI feel

Organizing multiple content sections for a real-world homepage structure

Managing typography and icons using Google Fonts and Font Awesome

📌 Next Steps:

Add JavaScript functionality for search, interactive sliders, and dynamic content

Implement API integration for real travel data

Enhance animations for smoother user experience

This project was a great exercise in replicating a professional, content-rich website interface, and it gave me deeper confidence in my frontend development skills.
